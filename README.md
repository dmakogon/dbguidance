While this is just kicking off, the thought is to build content around:

  - Understanding the different data store types
    - SQL databases
    - [Document databases](documentdatabases/docdatabaseoverview.md)
    - Key/value databases
    - Column databases
    - [Graph databases](graph/graphdb.md)
  - Navigating the (growing) list of 1st-party Azure database services and related offerings
    - [Data stores](azure/datastores.md)
    - Ancillary services
  - Deciding between Azure Services and and alternative options:
    - [DocumentDB vs VM-based document database stores and 3rd-party hosters](documentdatabases/docdb-or-3rdparty.md)
    - [Graph database options and 3rd-party hosters](graph/graphdb-options.md)
    - [SQL Database, SQL Server, and 3rd-party relational database stores](sql/sqldb-or-3rdparty.md)
  - Ancillary services
    - [Navigating the Hadoop ecosystem](hadoop/hadoop.md)
  - Business decisions: Costs and risks
