Guidance around choosing the right database technologies

This guidance is intended to help make decisions about which database engine (or engines) to incorporate into your applications.

While this is just kicking off, the thought is to build content around:

  - Navigating the (growing) list of 1st-party Azure database services and related offerings
  - Deciding between 1st-party and 3rd-party options:
    - [DocumentDB vs 3rd-party document database stores](documentdatabases/docdb-or-3rdparty.md)
  - [Navigating the Hadoop ecosystem](hadoop/hadoop.md)
  - [SQL Database, SQL Server, and 3rd-party relational database stores](sql/sqldb-or-3rdparty.md)
