    - Ancillary services
  - Deciding between Azure Services and and alternative options:
    - [DocumentDB vs VM-based document database stores and 3rd-party hosters](documentdatabases/docdb-or-3rdparty.md)
    - [Graph database options and 3rd-party hosters](graph/graphdb-options.md)
  - [Navigating the Hadoop ecosystem](hadoop/hadoop.md)
  - [SQL Database, SQL Server, and 3rd-party relational database stores](sql/sqldb-or-3rdparty.md)
